            "The difference between the sMAPC and the sMAPE is that the former compares forecasts to forecasts whereas the latter compares forecasts to observed values. While the sMAPC is defined here in terms of two adjacent forecasting origins, $t-1$ and $t$, it can also be calculated for pairs of nonadjacent forecasting origins. In this work, however, we only consider pairs of adjacent forecasting origins to quantify instability. The instability across different pairs of forecasting origins can be obtained by averaging their corresponding sMAPC values. From the forecasts shown in Fig. 1, an sMAPC of 3.99 is obtained. The second row in Table 1 shows that forecast instability also increases with increasing forecast horizon. In other words, the size by which a longer-horizon forecast changes due to forecast updating is larger on average compared to changes in shorter-horizon forecasts.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the above example, updating forecasts thus results in both benefits and costs caused by more accurate forecasts and induced forecast instability, respectively, with an sMAPE of 10.85 and an sMAPC of 3.99 across forecast horizons. Comparing these values with a scenario in which we do not update the forecasts, i.e., in which we rely on the forecasts produced at time $t=130$ and 136, irrespective of the period we are in, illustrates the possible tradeoff between forecast accuracy and forecast stability: as shown in the bottom two rows in Table 1, for these two forecasting origins, the sMAPE and sMAPC are equal to 12.98 and 0 , respectively. If forecasts are not updated, we do not incur any additional costs due to induced forecast instability; however, we also cannot benefit from potential improvements in forecast accuracy. Finding a good balance between forecast accuracy and forecast stability by approaching this problem as a tradeoff requires full quantification of their associated costs and benefits, which is often difficult in practice (as is the case for the provided examples of macroeconomic forecasting and demand forecasting for supply chain planning). However, the application of forecast updating in practice implicitly assumes that the induced costs are outweighed by the benefits for the forecasting problem at hand. Therefore, in this paper, we do not approach the relation between forecast accuracy and forecast stability from a tradeoff perspective, but instead focus on assessing whether we can improve forecast stability while maintaining forecast accuracy.\n",

            "Oreshkin et al. (2020) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of N-BEATS for all the data sets considered in their study, including the M3 and M4 data sets, and for both configurations of the model presented: a generic and an interpretable configuration. While the interpretable configuration relies on time-series-specific components (trend and seasonality) to achieve interpretability without considerable loss in accuracy, the generic configuration does not and can therefore be considered a pure deep learning model. The state-of-the-art performance of the generic model suggests that pure deep learning models can compete with and even outperform hybrid methods such as the best-performing method in M4 (Smyl, 2020) that combines recurrent neural networks with exponential smoothing. In this paper, we therefore focus on the generic configuration. Below, we briefly discuss this generic N-BEATS architecture.\n",
            "\n",
            "N-BEATS takes as input a vector of $T$ historical observations, also referred to as the lookback window, $\\mathbf{x}_{T \\mid t} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{T}=\\left[y_{t-T+1}, \\ldots, y_{t}\\right]$ with length $T \\leq t$ and forecasting origin $t$ and outputs a prediction $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_{h \\mid t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}=\\left[\\hat{y}_{t+1 \\mid t}\\right.$, $\\left.\\ldots, \\hat{y}_{t+h \\mid t}\\right]$ for the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{h \\mid t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}=\\left[y_{t+1}, \\ldots, y_{t+h}\\right]$ which comprises the next $h$ observations. The length $T$ of the lookback window $\\mathbf{x}_{T \\mid t}$ is set to a multiple of the forecast horizon $h$, with lengths ranging from $2 h$ to $7 h$ in Oreshkin et al. (2020). The generic N-BEATS architecture, visualized in Fig. 2, is composed of multiple sequentially connected processing blocks $k=1, \\ldots, K$, with the number of blocks $K$ being a hyperparameter. Each block $k$ takes $\\mathbf{x}_{T \\mid t}^{(k)}$ as input to produce both a partial forecast $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_{h \\mid t}^{(k)}$ and a backcast $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{T \\mid t}^{(k)}$ by going through a stack of four fully connected layers with ReLu nonlinearity and a single taskspecific layer for each block output, i.e., the backcast and (partial) forecast. The difference between the block input $\\mathbf{x}_{T \\mid t}^{(k)}$ and the backcast $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_{T \\mid t}^{(k)}$ forms the input of the next block in the network (with $\\mathbf{x}_{T \\mid t}^{(1)}=\\mathbf{x}_{T \\mid t}$ ). The final forecast $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}_{h \\mid t}$ is the sum of the (partial) block forecasts. The authors refer to this topology as doubly residual stacking:\n",
